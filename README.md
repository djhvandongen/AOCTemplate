# AOCTemplate
A template for Advent of Code in C#

This template can be used by creating classes in the form of DayXX.cs, where XX is in the range of 01 - 25.

Those classes should go in the Code folder.

The input files have the same name convention, but a .txt extension, e.g. DayXX.txt. 

These should go in the Input folder.
